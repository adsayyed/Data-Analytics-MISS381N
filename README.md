# Project Summary

The team took a kaggle movie dataset of all movies released between 1927 - 2016. The questions we asked once completing an exploratory analysis was: "Can we predict movie ratings?", "Can we construct a model to predict revenue and budget based on variables provided?", "Which movies, actors, and directors were most notable?"

This question was interesting as the new wave of media consumption (Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Max) can utilize inisghts from such analyses to understand what kinds of movies/genres are successful and what areas to focus on for their customer bases. This leads to the potential of further maximizing profits if done correctly.

OLS regressions as well as decision tree models were used to address our project.
